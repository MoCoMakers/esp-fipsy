# TcpFipsyLoader example

In this example, the ESP32 receives a JEDEC file via TCP, and programs Fipsy once the file has been verified.

## Wiring

ESP32 pin | Fipsy pin
----------|----------
3V3       | 1
GND       | 2
14        | 3
12        | 4
13        | 5
15        | 6

## Usage

1. Modify WiFi setting in this sketch, and upload to ESP32.
2. Look for the IP address in serial output.
3. In Lattice Diamond, compile a JEDEC file for MachXO2-256.
4. Execute `nc esp32-ip-address 34779 < filename.jed`.

Sample interaction:

```shell
$ nc 192.168.5.58 34779 < 1.jed
JEDEC OK, fuse checksum: A0A5
Feature Row: 0 0
FEABITS: 420
Programming ...
Success
```
